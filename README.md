# WDC Library

## Overview

This library simplifies interacting with the WCPS server and provides methods to dynamically create WCPS queries, send them, and optionally process data locally. Using this library, WCPS becomes more accessible for Python developers who aim to use and perform operations on datacubes from servers that store multi-dimensional coverages.
