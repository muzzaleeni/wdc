WCPS Datacube Interaction Library wdc library provides a streamlined Python interface for interacting with Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS) servers for data retrieval and processing from datacubes such as those provided by Rasdaman.

using this repository(((( https://your-repository-link.com/wdc_project.git ))))

The provided Python codebase facilitates interaction with a Rasdaman server, executing WCPS queries to fetch and process coverage data. The DatabaseConnection class establishes a connection to the server, while the Datacube class allows fetching images from datacubes using WCPS queries. Additionally, the code integrates the CoverageQuery and Rasdaman classes for more advanced querying and interaction with the Rasdaman server. By combining these components, users can efficiently retrieve and process coverage data from the Rasdaman server, making it a versatile tool for working with geospatial data in Python environments.
